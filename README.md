# Early-detection-of-pest-production-in-grain-Silos-Storage.
This project presents an AI-enabled early pest detection system for grain silos using real-time sensor data. The system continuously monitors temperature, humidity, gas concentration, and ultrasonic distance variations to identify early signs of pest infestation and structural changes inside the silo. Sensor readings are analyzed using a lightweight AI model to classify risk levels and trigger alerts through visual and audible indicators. By enabling early intervention, the system helps prevent grain spoilage, economic loss, and safety hazards, while remaining suitable for low-cost and scalable agricultural deployment.
